They roam the lands spreading word of the power of Razmir, and using that power to convince the unfaithful of their misplaced loyalties in other gods and governments.

The Razmiran priest, one of the most powerful of Razmir’s servants, brings the Living God’s gifts to the common folk and his wrath to his enemies. From behind his mask, the priest judges all he sees, meting out harsh justice in the name of his deity. Many doubt the powers of the clergy, and some would even dare to call Razmir “false.” These fools soon learn the error of their ways when the Razmiran priest pays them a visit, using the gifts of the god to smite such heretics.

A devotee who wishes to become one of Razmir’s most trusted priests must undergo a lengthy ritual in the capital of Thronestep. It is said that Razmir himself conducts the final steps of the ritual, blessing the new priest and judging his purity. Those who are found worthy emerge from this secret, mysterious process as absolute believers, while those deemed inadequate are never seen again. A new Razmiran priest finds himself on a quick path to power, prestige, and wealth, as the hierarchy of Razmir’s faith treats most priests as superiors.

These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.

At 6th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or brilliant energy. Moreover, a herald of wrath gains access to additional weapon properties based on their alignment:

A lawful herald can gain axiomatic. 
A chaotic herald can gain anarchic. 
A good herald can gain disruption and holy. 
An evil herald can gain unholy.

Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost. These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. 

The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. This ability imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone  other than the herald but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the herald. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon.

This ability counts as a Paladin Divine Bond weapon for the sake of any feats, abilities, or features that would modify Divine Bond."

Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels – the perfect servants of good – as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.
			
Tenets of Devotion

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, champions of this oath share these tenets.

Honesty - Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

Courage - Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

Compassion - Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

Honor - Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.

Duty - Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you."

They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things-leaves, antlers, or flowers-to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.
			
Tenets of the Ancients

The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

Kindle the Light - Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.

Shelter the Light - Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.

Preserve Your Own Light - Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.

Be the Light - Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds."

When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside – at times like these, champions arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these champions – sometimes called avengers or dark knights – their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.
Tenets of Vengeance

The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by champion, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Champions who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the champions are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.

Fight the Greater Evil - Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.

No Mercy for the Wicked - Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

By Any Means Necessary - My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.

Restitution - If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds."

They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.

Some of these champions go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these champions – called hell knights – as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other champions of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.

Tenets of Conquest

A champion who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.

Douse the Flame of Hope - It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies’ will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.

Rule with an Iron Fist - Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow.

Strength Above All - You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin."

Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure.

Many of these champions pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz’t and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard’s penchant for double dealing and treachery

Tenets of Treachery

A champion who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one. There are no tenets of this oath, for it lacks any substance. Those who are unfortunate enough to have close contact with blackguards have observed that a blackguard’s overwhelming concern is power and safety, especially if both can be obtained at the expense of others."
